## üß† Overview

This week is dedicated to learning and mastering Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java.

## üìò Topics Covered

### Day 1: Object-Oriented Programming Fundamentals
- Introduction to OOP concepts: classes, objects, and methods  
- Understanding how Java supports OOP principles  

### Day 2: Java Constructors, Instance vs. Class Variables, Access Modifiers
- Defining constructors and their role  
- Difference between instance variables and class (static) variables  
- Access modifiers: `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default  

### Day 3: this, static, final Keywords and instanceof Operator
- Usage of the `this` keyword  
- Understanding `static` and `final` keywords  
- The `instanceof` operator for type checking  

### Day 4: Object Modeling and Class Diagrams
- Basics of object modeling  
- Creating and interpreting class diagrams  

### Day 5: Inheritance
- Concept of inheritance and subclassing  
- Using `super` keyword and method overriding  

### Day 6: Encapsulation, Interfaces, Abstract Classes, and Polymorphism
- Principles of encapsulation  
- Using interfaces and abstract classes  
- Understanding polymorphism and dynamic method dispatch

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Completion of Week 1 Java Basics (especially familiarity with Java syntax, variables, control flow, arrays, strings, and functions).
- A computer with a supported operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 17+ recommended).
- A code editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.
